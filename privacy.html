    <h1>Privacy Policy for Deep Match</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: February 3, 2026</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Deep Match ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>We prioritize user privacy and do not collect any personal data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Personal Information:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, physical addresses, or authentication details.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Content:</strong> To provide our price comparison service, the extension reads public product information (including product titles, prices, and image URLs) from the shopping websites you visit (specifically amazon.com and amazon.ca).</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This data is used solely to identify the product you are viewing and to find more economical alternatives on other global retail platforms in real-time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Affiliate Disclosure and Data Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Affiliate Links:</strong> When the extension identifies a lower price, it may provide a link to the product via an affiliate program (such as the AliExpress Affiliate Program). We may earn a small commission if you make a purchase through these links. This results in no additional cost to you and helps us maintain our free service.</li>
        <li><strong>No Third-Party Sales:</strong> We do not sell, trade, or rent any user data to third parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend Communication:</strong> Public product details are sent to our secure backend server (make-it-cheaper.vercel.app) strictly to retrieve matching price information. This data is processed anonymously and is not linked to any individual user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use your browser's local storage (chrome.storage) to cache price comparison results. This is used to improve the performance of the extension and reduce unnecessary network requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> All communication between the extension and our backend server is encrypted using HTTPS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:<br>
